+   /* For clear tiles in HTILE, TC uses the upper bit of the tile to determine the depth clear value
+    * for the tile (0 or 1).
+    *
+    * If all samples covering a clear tile were discarded by late Z (such as via `discard` in the
+    * pixel shader, sample mask output, alpha to coverage), the tile stays clear.
+    *
+    * However, on some chips, when late Z discards samples, the Z range in the tile still gets
+    * updated, and that may change the upper bit of HTILE (max Z in the depth-only encoding, Z base
+    * in the depth/stencil encoding), thus making TC assume the tile was cleared to a different
+    * value.
+    *
+    * On the affected chips, when using the depth/stencil HTILE encoding, ZRANGE_PRECISION must be
+    * set to 0 after clearing depth to 0.0f (so the Z base is the min Z, and the upper bit stays 0),
+    * and to 1 after clearing depth to 1.0f (so the Z base is the max Z, and the upper bit stays 1).
+    *
+    * On certain chips, the depth-only HTILE encoding is also affected, so the depth/stencil
+    * encoding with the workaround needs to be used for TC-compatible HTILE even if no stencil
+    * aspect is present.
