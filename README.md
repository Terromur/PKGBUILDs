# PKGBUILDs

This is my personal collection of PKGBUILDs that I maintain and adheres to the
following principles:

- No bloating

- No extreme patching

- Only the essentials

That's why some of packages carry the suffix "-pure". Some of the packages like
mesa-pure are customized for my personal hardware. The rest of the PKGBUILDs
can be used by you at will, but note that I am a lazy maintainer and do not:

1) Accept requests for feature X

2) Consider issues with packages designed for my hardware.

3) Add any extreme optimizations and compiler flags.

And yes, **please do not send bug reports with these packages to Arch
Linux or upstream!** That's all.
